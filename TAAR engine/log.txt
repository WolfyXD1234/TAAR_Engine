fixed an issue with the combatant being saved inside the list instead of being saved using the name in the list in CreateCombatant
worked on the ReadMe
created classes.py so i have a spot to work on some wierd stuff
trying to wrap my head arround passing a function as an argument of an object in a class

10.23.25 Wolfy
merged classes.py into TAAR_Engine.py
trying to see if I even should have action be classes or not
    I did make them classes
ugh I need to update the ReadMe
    Removed the bad info
    Adding in the new info is a later me problem :3
updating the tester seems to require creating a new function to create actions

10.28.25 Wolfy
creating that new function per me last week
Figuring out how to refrence an objecct using a list containing its name
changed the list containing the names of combatants to a dictionary with the name as a key and the combatant as the value

10.30.25 Wolfy
The ever lasting question of what to work on
Removed the function I made last week and changed the code in CreateCombatant to create a better resault than having 2 functions
Need to figure out how to get charecters to print properly now
